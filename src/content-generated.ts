In terms of user\nexperience, today no brand can boast of offering features as simple and\nintuitive as AirDrop (though technically imperfect), Handoff, or iMessage with\ncontinuity between connected devices.

If you can implement a part in a 500-line\nfile, why insist on separating things into 10 files of 50 lines each? What does\nit bring immediately?

Writing unit tests for React components doesn't guarantee that your\napplication works. It guarantees that your components work according to the\ntests you've specified. Through your perspective and biases. Whereas setting up\nfunctional tests, which perform real actions on your application, will guarantee\nthat your application works with a much more interesting degree of certainty.\nAnd that's much more important than knowing if your component is \"rendered\" with\nthe right props. And rendering, what is it? Does testing CSS props really tells\nyou if your button is clickable in practice? Rarely will you have as high a\ndegree of certainty as with a functional test. Having a program that performs\nuser actions, clicks, scrolls, inputs, and checks that the result is as expected\nis much more powerful and relevant.
