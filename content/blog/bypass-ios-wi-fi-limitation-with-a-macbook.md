title: Bypass iOS Wi-Fi usage limitation for downloads when you have a MacBook around

I use this technique for 2 reasons:

- I live in the country, and my cellular connection is WAY better than my ADSL
  (40Mb/s vs 2Mb/s) so when I can‚Äôt wait for an iOS big download, I want to rely
  on my LTE connection (eg: OTA update like a iOS DEVELOPER BETA OMG I WANT THIS
  ONE RIGHT NOW). I never use my Wi-Fi at home (only my computer use ADSL via
  Ethernet).
- I am moving for work from time to time and mostly rely on my cellular
  connection (I barely rely on Wi-Fi that hotels or clients offers me). If I
  want to download a huge app or need a huge update, iOS limitation is very
  annoying (even for iOS backups btw).

So to by-pass this iOS limitation **when you have a MacBook around**, there is a
trick. Pretty easy to do.

First, enable personal hotspot on iOS.

Then connect your iOS device to your MacBook via USB.

_Yeah we are going to share something to the MacBook and the MacBook is going to
share it with us._

üôÉ

Go to Newtork Preferences and check that iPhone/iPad USB is active (uncheck
‚ÄúDisable unless needed‚Äù to be sure).

Now go to Sharing Preferences

- Share your connection from ‚ÄúiPhone USB‚Äù
- To computers using ‚ÄúWi-FI‚Äù

Now go on your iOS device and connect to the Wi-Fi network named after your
computer.

That‚Äôs it. Can seems stupid but currently with macOS 10.14 and iOS 12 it‚Äôs
perfectly working.

Hope this trick will help! üôÇ
