I've been fighting with CSS long enough in production now that I don’t enjoy
working with it anymore unfortunately, so at least for now this my formal
farewell! [\*](https://medium.com/@tjholowaychuk/farewell-node-js-4ba9e7f3e52b)

CSS has been designed to style documents, not applications. Anyone that has
tried to use CSS at scale knows how it requires too many restrictions and rules
to make it work. In short, it's painful and not really a pleasure.

CSS selectors are the main problem we have to face with CSS. It's like global
mutable variables. Because of how selectors works, it's very hard to know if
removing a piece of CSS is ok or not. There is still no way to write trustable
scoped CSS. So yeah, you can use BEM, CSS modules and other fancy tools &
methodologies, but at the end of the day, those are just patches that require
strict methodologies and tooling. Not solution for the future.

Many have already talked & written about the limits of CSS for apps and the most
accurate reference to me is still one of the first (from 2014).

To refresh your memory, here is the list of problems that you encounter when
working with CSS on apps

* No local variables.
* Implicit dependencies.
* No dead code elimination.
* No code minification.
* No sharing of constants.
* Non-deterministic resolution.
* No isolation.

The way CSS is currently evolving won't fix anything.

## CSS-in-JS, until we get something better

Meanwhile, CSS-in-JS is becoming clearly more and more popular as it can help to
avoid all those problems and also has some benefits:

* Generates the minimum required CSS.
* Offers good runtime performance.
* Supports static and dynamic styles.
* Helps to pre-render critical CSS.

At the end, at least for now on the web, we still use CSS, but as a low-level
primitive (like React is using the DOM). Just like any code we write ends up
being compiled to a language that our computer will understand.

When relying on a good abstraction, you can write code similar to CSS (without
selectors) that will work in other places, thanks to
[Yoga](http://yogalayout.com). Yoga is the solution used in
[React-Native](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/) and some others engines.
Yoga is just an example and you can probably find other alternatives like
[flex](https://github.com/jordwalke/flex) (a Yoga reimplementation in
[Reason](https://reasonml.github.io/)).

In addition to previous benefits, using this kind of solution also adds

* Simple API and expressive subset of CSS.
* Support for RTL layouts.
* Easy pre-rendering of critical CSS (if your target compilation is the web)
* Statically type-checked styles ♥️.

## “But you don't know how to use CSS”

For those that are going to say something like

> But if you are smart, you will use cascading to your advantage

Before saying anything like this, be sure that:

* you haven't shipped one-shot projects only without having to maintain those on
  the long run
* you actually had more than 1000 CSS selectors in production for a single
  project

Using CSS for small projects is probably ok, but it's not for medium and large
websites/apps. Please watch and read about the motivations of CSS-in-JS until we
are convinced. And if you are not... 🙃

## Deprecating cssnext

For these reasons, I will only use CSS when I will use HTML directly, so that
means 2 times per year when I do a real quick landing page.

I really believe that CSS will become a low level primitive, a target for
compilation, and nothing more in the near future. And for a far future, it may
even become obsolete and not used.

This is why I am [deprecating cssnext](../deprecating-cssnext/) as of today.

## What's next for me?

I work with the React ecosystem this days and I am already happy with
[React Native StyleSheet](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/stylesheet.html)
API (that works on [the web](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web) too).

(If you ask me _"what about media queries and pseudo elements?"_, I don't need
those. I think media queries are not good enough (element queries could be a
thing I would use tho) and pseudo elements are clearly oriented for document
styling. See also
[react-native-web Style FAQ](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web/blob/master/website/guides/style.md#faqs).

Currently I am even using RN StyleSheet API via
[Reason](https://reasonml.github.io/) and
[bs-react-native](https://github.com/reasonml-community/bs-react-native) that
brings me strong static typed validation. No more debugging for a stupid typo.

I also look forward to
[react-native-dom](https://github.com/vincentriemer/react-native-dom).
